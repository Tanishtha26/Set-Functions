# Set-Functions
Set is a mathematical Concept (more specifically Disrete Mathematical).
In this Code Set Functions got implemented using C++ without using any STL Containers.
Note: The Set got implemented through Arrays in C++ (assigned statically not dynamically) - thus, you may recieve warnings in the compiler but ignore them for now.
